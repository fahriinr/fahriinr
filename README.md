## Hi there 👋 I'm Fahri

I'm a curious developer who loves building clean, scalable apps and solving tricky bugs with a smile 😄. Whether it's crafting smooth UIs in Flutter or wiring up backend logic with Supabase, I enjoy making things work—and making them work well.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- 💙 Flutter & Dart — for beautiful, reactive mobile apps
- ⚛️ React & JavaScript/TypeScript — for snappy web interfaces
- 🧠 Supabase — for authentication, database, and backend magic

### 🚀 Projects

- **DuitTracker** — A Flutter app to track your spending and stay financially sane. Built with Hive for local storage.
- **Split-Bill** — A ReactJS web app to split expenses with friends without the awkward math.

I’m always learning, refactoring, and trying to make my workflow more teachable and reusable. If you’re into clean architecture, debugging weird edge cases, or just geeking out over state management, we’ll probably get along!
